this is the place for maturing apps, that I have not yet decided to document and package for others because
I feel they are not yet good enough.

once those get good enough and start deserving documentation and packaging, they will be moved to their own repos

- accounts is a template app for account realted stuff, which will probably be copied and overwriden in every project

- static is meant to contain templates that were too small to fit anywherelse + their settings
