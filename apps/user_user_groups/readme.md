- table sort 1 1
    compatible with checkboxes (sort by checked?!)
- find select widget 2 1
- search group
- copy and delete multiple, without serverside sumbit differentiation.
    in html5
        input form="id1 id2" 
        form id="id1"
        form id="id2"
    should work, but in firefox, only works with single id

    alternative is to use same form, and differentiate on server,
    which is ugly

- like group
- tag group
